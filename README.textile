h1. DESCRIPTION

This project contains set of scripts to make your life with
Linux booted from USB key and running entirely in RAM much easier.

When you run Linux operating system completely in ram (/ is mounted on tmpfs),
you want preserve changes you made to system between system reboots and this is
what this project provides ;)

This project consist of two scripts:

* diskless-usb-save-os
Creates gzipped tarball of */* directory to specified location and
updates syslinux configuration using *diskless-usb-create-syslinux-config*

* diskless-usb-create-syslinux-config
Creates/generates syslinux.cfg configuration from discovered
list of operating system tarballs created by *diskless-usb-save-os*

h1. HOWTO

* create configuration file and edit it
bc. 
diskless-usb-save-os --default-config > /etc/linux-usb-diskless/diskless-usb-save-os.conf
vi /etc/linux-usb-diskless/diskless-usb-save-os.conf

* create syslinux configuration generator template files:

bc. 
diskless-usb-create-syslinux-config --default-template > /etc/linux-usb-diskless/syslinux.cfg.template
diskless-usb-create-syslinux-config --default-label-template > /etc/linux-usb-diskless/syslinux-label.template

* edit label template file

bc. 
 # Available variables:
 #
 # ${ARCHIVE_FILE}:        OS archive file basename
 # ${ARCHIVE_FILE_FULL}:   OS archive file full name
 # ${INDEX}:               OS archive index number
 LABEL linux-${INDEX}
        MENU LABEL [${INDEX}] OS ${ARCHIVE_FILE}
        # change this to kernel path on your USB key
        kernel kernels/vmlinuz-2.6.35-28.49
        # change this to initrd/initramfs image on your USB key
        initrd kernels/initrd.igz
        # kernel boot parameters; you're completely on your own here;
        # if you're using linux-diskless-init, you should change at
        # least real_root parameter
        append ro tmpfs_size=500M vga=791 real_root=:/os-images/${ARCHIVE_FILE}

* insert USB key

* do the testrun!

bc. 
diskless-usb-save-os -c /etc/linux-usb-diskless/diskless-usb-save-os.conf


h1. PACKAGES

See *contrib/* directory for building distribution specific packages.

h2. Debian/Ubuntu

Creating Debian/Ubuntu compatible *DEB* package is extremely easy:

bc. 
    cd contrib/debian
    sudo ./package.debian
